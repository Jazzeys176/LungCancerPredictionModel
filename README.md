## üõ†Ô∏è **Steps Involved**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning**  
- Utilized **Pandas** for data preprocessing, ensuring the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Selection**  
- Applied **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to identify the most significant features contributing to the prediction.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Modeling**  
- Implemented the **XGBoost Classifier**, a robust and efficient gradient boosting algorithm, to perform the classification task.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Visualization**  
- Created:  
  - A **heatmap** to explore feature correlations.  
  - **Feature Importance charts** to highlight the role of each feature in prediction.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Evaluation**  
- Evaluated model performance using:  
  - **ROC-AUC Score**  
  - **Classification Report**  
  - **Confusion Matrix**
